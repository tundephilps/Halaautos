              Abdul Latif Jameel Motors Guest First principles have guided the
              company to provide facilities and services to make the purchase
              and ownership of a Toyota vehicle as satisfying as possible. Our
              vehicle sales and distribution network features outlets across
              Saudi Arabia, and we are able to source and service over 1.2
